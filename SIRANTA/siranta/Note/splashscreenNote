By default, the splash screen will be removed when Flutter has drawn the first frame. If you would like the splash screen to remain while your app initializes, you can use the preserve() and remove() methods together. Pass the preserve() method the value returned from WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() to keep the splash on screen. Later, when your app has initialized, make a call to remove() to remove the splash screen.

import 'package:flutter_native_splash/flutter_native_splash.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsBinding widgetsBinding = WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FlutterNativeSplash.preserve(widgetsBinding: widgetsBinding);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// whenever your initialization is completed, remove the splash screen:
    FlutterNativeSplash.remove();


NOTE: If you do not need to use the preserve() and remove() methods, you can place the flutter_native_splash dependency in the dev_dependencies section of pubspec.yaml.
